# Project0 - Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Overview

Building a Tic-Tac-Toe game which will render in the browser. 

The purpose of the exercise is to build a web application from scratch with 'DRY' principles. 

The aim of the game is for either player to get three in a row. 

## Motivation

Tic-Tac-Toe is a really fun game that everyone really recognises and it's a common rite of passage for developers when learning how to code. 

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Animate.css

### Features

One thing that makes my project stand out would be the use of different markers through the üòº and üê∂ emojis as opposed to the conventional 'X' and 'O'. Additionally, the 3x3 grid is slightly different: I added a border around it because I thought it would look nicer as a cube. 

### Difficulties encountered when building this

* Initially, I mistakenly didn't realise that the 3x3 grid would have 9 squares. I only anticipated needing 6 and I had trouble understanding how to make the grid work. 
* I had trouble positioning the restart-game button - currently positioned on the left, but it needs to be more centered. 

### How to use?

A special thanks to CJ, Mark and Tina for helping me flesh this out and iron out any bugs that I came across whilst building this.
