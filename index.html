<!-- Keep track of which player's turn it is and update the game board with their mark (e.g. "X" or "O") when a square is clicked.
Check for a winner after each turn. A player wins when they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
If there is a winner, display a message to let the players know who won.
If all the squares are filled and there is no winner, display a message to let the players know that the game ended in a tie. -->
