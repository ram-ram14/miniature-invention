<!-- 

Write a function that will set up the game when the page loads. This function should initialize the game board and display it on the screen.

Write a function that will handle player moves. This function should be called whenever a player clicks on a square on the board. It should check if the square is already occupied, and if it is not, it should update the board with the player's move and switch to the other player's turn.

Write a function that will check for a winner after each move. This function should check if there are three X's or O's in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If there is a winner, it should end the game and display a message announcing the winner.

Write a function that will end the game if there is a tie. This function should be called when there are no more moves left and neither player has won.

Update your HTML and JavaScript files to include functionality for starting a new game once the current game has ended. You can do this by adding a "New Game" button or link that will reset the game board and start a new game.

Test your game to make sure it works as expected. You may need to make adjustments to your code and styling to get everything working smoothly.  -->
